1- create a server block with the correct directives. Instead of modifying the default configuration file directly,
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-domain.conf

2- Past this code in your-domain.conf
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name admin.kawaraa.com;

 location / { 
   proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; 
   }
}

3- Enable the file by creating a link from it to the sites-enabled directory, which Nginx reads from during startup:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-domain.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

4- Test to make sure that there are no syntax errors in any of your Nginx files
sudo nginx -t

5- Restart Nginx to enable your changes
sudo systemctl restart nginx

6- Create and install the SSL via CertBot
7- Alter the server block to redirect the http to https

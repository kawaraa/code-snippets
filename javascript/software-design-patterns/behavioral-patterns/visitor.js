// Visitor Pattern separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the objects. It's used when you have a set of related classes with differing interfaces and you want to perform operations on these objects without modifying their structure, particularly when adding new operations is anticipated or when the object structure is stable but the operations change
